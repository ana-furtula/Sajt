                    <div class="text">What many Catholics do for their Christmas, Serbians do for New Year's Eve! The
                        tree is decorated for this special night, so Santa can bring children presents under it at midnight.
                        They write their wishes on a list that they put under the tree. The fireworks must be seen at midnight so
                        nobody bothers Santa! Families usually celebrate New Year all together with some family friends at
                        somebody's home. The whole day is euphoric, special outfit is ready and the same movies are played on TV so
                        the holiday feeling can be felt. Young people or parents whose children have grown usually go to their
                        town/city square to listen to a concert or they go to some destination to do the same. Other option is
                        kafana, which is a Serbian version of a restaurant with live music, everything for having a great time!

                        more
                        dedicated than tomorrow on a Christmas Day. Fathers go with their friends and sons to the woods
                        to
                        find
                        Serbian version of Christmas tree, we call it ''badnjak'', and actually that is a young oak
                        branch.
                        After a long and cold day which they handle with a little help from rakija (Serbian brandy),
                        they
                        come
                        home to the female side of the family. Women make pogača and česnica/kravajče (traditional types
                        of
                        bread) and the rest of the traditional fasting food (such as fish, pie, beans, fruit...). They
                        put a
                        coin inside of česnica, so the member of the family who gets a part of it with the coin is
                        supposed
                        to
                        be happy and wealthy for the rest of the year. Also, the oak branch is set on fire due to the
                        old
                        customs.</div>

                        the
                        day
                        when family and friends meet in the morning at one of their homes and eat non-fasting food
                        (comparing to
                        the previous day). It is a day of joy and celebration. They all go to the local church and spend
                        the
                        day
                        visiting and seeing the relatives. In northern part of Serbia they split česnica on the
                        Christmas
                        day,
                        not the Christmas Eve.</div>

                    <div class="text">Unlike Good Friday which is considered the saddest holiday of all, Easter is
                        children's
                        and generally Christians' favorite holiday. The eggs are being colored in different colors, but
                        the
                        first one is always red and it is called The Housekeeper (it stayes in the house until the next
                        Easter).
                        The favorite activity of the day is ''the egg fight''. Everybody chooses their own egg and they
                        hit
                        someone else's egg to see which one continues to fight and which one is going to be eaten.
                        People
                        also
                        exchange eggs and when they visit other people's houses, they bring them eggs as a present. This
                        day
                        people are also supposed to go to church and they also bring eggs there in exchange for eggs
                        they
                        take
                        there.</div>

                    <div class="text">This is not a specific-date holiday. Every home that celebrates any slava has
                        their
                        saint
                        of the family. There are many saint days during the year, but the thing that decides on which
                        date
                        the
                        particular family celebrates is connected with the tradition of the family from man's side or
                        the
                        place
                        a family lives in (some villages have their own slava). The concept of the event is that the
                        host
                        doesn't invite people over, but everybody who wants to come is welcome. There is a lot of food
                        and
                        drinks on the table and people come at any time to talk to the hosts and the guests and have a
                        nice
                        time. The inevitable elements on the table are the candle, pogača (a particular round bread) and
                        red
                        wine. Usually, when a family does not celebrate slava that day, they go visit many people that
                        do
                        and
                        they go from house to house to show their respect. If you come to one's slava and the host
                        offers
                        you
                        with their home-made rakija, don't you dare to refuse it!</div>

                        the

                        people do not work that day, but instead go with their family and friends on a trip somewhere in
