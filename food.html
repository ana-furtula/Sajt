            <h4>Sour cabbage</h4>
            <p>In world more famous as Sauerkraut, it is raw cabbage that has been fermented by various lactic acid
                bacteria. It has a long shelf life and a distinctive sour flavor, and it is used as salad (cut and
                served with oil and paprika) or used for many dishes where it has to be cooked or roasted.</p>

            <h4>Sarma</h4>
