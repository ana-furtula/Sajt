            <h3>Wedding</h3>
            <p>Serbian wedding is a special event indeed. Number of flowers that a guest brings has to be odd and should
                not be yellowish, since it has always been the color of jealousy. When young girls put you a flower
                around your wrist or on your coat, you should tip them. Before you enter the garden, you should drink a
                sip of rakija from the best man who carries a bottle. Firstly, everyone is at the broom's, where the
                gypsy trumpet orchestra is playing while everyone is dancing the traditional dance kolo. After a few
                hours, the broom goes to the bride's house and has to ''buy her'' — that means that he offers money to
                her siblings or parents in order to show how much she means to me. It does sound odd and it has
                officially been forbidden since 1846, but these days it is not a real sale, it is just an interesting
                custom and a chance for much laugh! One more fascinating custom is that bride's father sets an apple on
                the hisghest tree and the broom has to take it down by shooting with rifle. After a while, they all go
                to the church to get married and also to the city hall afterwars. In the end, when the couple is
                officially married, everybody celebrates it in a restaurant, usually in a big one surrounded with a huge
                number of people. When the party is over and the newlyweds come home, the bride throughs an apple behind
                her back for luck and happiness, and a sieve on the roof with hope that she will succeed and that the
                couple will remain happilly married with children in the future.</p>

            <h3>Jadac</h3>
            <p>This word explains a game which has been made over a chicken bone and betting. The particular bone has
                two sides which two people take and break it while saying the price in the bet. A way for one to win the
                bet is to give physically anything to the other person without them remembering about the bet. If a
                person that is about to be tricked remembers, they have to say ''I know about jadac'' and they are safe
                for now.</p>

            <h3>Red Thread</h3>
            <p>There is a belief that tying a red thread around left wrist as a bracelet can protect a person from the
                evil and give them luck in life. It is a common thing in the rest of the world too, but Serbia is a
                specific country where religion and superstition are oftenly mixed and misunderstood, so the story about
                the red thread has probably found its way to our people through the Jewish culture. It is most often put
                on babies' hand in order to keep them safe from evil and diseases.</p>

            <h3>A Newborn</h3>
            <p>When a new child is born, it stays in hospital like its mum. Meanwhile, dad has people coming over to
                celebrate the birth of the baby and of course, aside from drinking, there is a specific custom for this
                event too! Whoever comes over (the other men), has to rip off a little bit of the dad's shirt. If they
                keep a part of the cloth in their hand, it is believed to mean that they will soon have a child of the
                same gender. In first 40 days since the baby is born, ''babine'' are celebrated. This custom has a very
                deep and far origin in the past, but only a few things have remained. People that come over should bring
                a roast chicken with head (so the newborn remains sane), a cheese/apple pie (so the child would be loved
                from the opposite gender), a round cake (so the child would avoid ''life angles''), a round bread (it is
                split among the children and the gender of the child that bites it first will be the gender of the next
                baby in the family and the bitten part stays in the crib for 40 days) or money (when put in the crib, a
                guest says ''This is for you to buy a book/pencil/chocolate...'')</p>

            <h3>3, 2, 1 — It's Christmas</h3>
            <p>The unit of the countdown is weeks. Prepare well for the following because it may sound a little weird,
                but we promise it is safe and has a great symbolism and joy behind it. On Sunday 3 weeks before
                Christmas parents tie their children and they have to pay their parents in order to get untied. This
                custom is not meant to hurt anyone, but just to teach children how to save and value what they have. If
                children have remembered to save some fruit, objects, coins or anything similar, they give it to their
                parents for them to untie them, but if they haven't, they must promise they will be good that year.
                Children are usually very excited about this custom. Next Sunday, 2 weeks before Christmas, the same is
                done with the mother. She acts surprised and says how she cannot make lunch that day if they do not let
                her go, so she also ''pays'' them with something. In the past, old Belgradian ladies used to give
                presents to charity on this very day. Finally, a week before Christmas, dad is the one being tied.</p>

            <h3>Water For Luck</h3>
            <p>If you have an important test, exam, job interview, date or so, a Serbian will escort you to the door
                with a glass of water and will spill it behind you to wish you good luck!</p>

            <h3>Vampires</h3>
            <p>One of the two worldwide accepted words that come from Serbian language is ''vampire''. It is probably
                because of the way people were explaining strange events, robberies and murders in their villages. If
                there wasn't for the Serbian imagination, you would have never watched The Vampire Diaries, or at least
                they would have been named differently...</p>

            <p>People afraid of the possibility to jinx something good that is happening or afraid of anything bad that
                can happen generally, knock on wood and move from that exact spot. The important thing is not to knock
                on the same wood twice.</p>

            <h3>Kolo (national dance)</h3>
            <p>Kolo is a circular group dance where all the people that dance hold each other's hand, creating a chain
                in which everybody usually dance the same steps at the same time. There are many types of this dance,
                depending on the region where they came from or on the type of steps. More simple and popular kinds of
                kolo are danced on weddings and big birthday parties or any kind of big parties and celebrations in
                restaurants, usually with live musics. In the past kolo was being danced even when youth was going out
                and it was very typical for any gathering. However, these days kolo is more typical for the elderly,
                while young people usually dance more modern ''clublike'' dances because the way they celebrate
                important days is changing. There are many folklore ensembles in Serbia that represent our country in
                world.</p>
